        <p>
          I have always been doodling in my notebooks. If you go through one of
          them, it might actually be hard to figure out what is really going on
          between all the lines, spaceships and corny-looking people. <br /> For
          all my life i have been a creative person who loves thinking outside
          of the box, and doing things a little bit differently. <br /> Combined
          with my ever-increasing interest in anything with an electrical
          circut, i have channeled all of this into my greatest passion.
          Creating beautiful websites for you.
